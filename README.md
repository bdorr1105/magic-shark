# magic-shark
Tool written in python that allows you to analyze pcaps. There is no functionality built in for live capture. This is only meant for analysis on already captured pcaps. There are 12 hunts you can.

|:exclamation:  Warning   This was tested on a pcap that was only 25mb. Use this the same way you would use Wireshark, as in, do not try and use super large pcaps. It may still work, but I can't tell you how long it would take to parse.
